								<b>Education:</b> I am an international undergraduate student at Westminster College, Utah. I was born and raised in
								Lima, Peru and decided to move to Salt Lake City to pursue a Bachelor of Science in a liberal arts college because I
								like collaborative and hands-on learning environments. I am currently an honors physics and math student with
								an emphasis in data science. This experience has taught me how to be an independent thinker, respect learning as a
								process itself, and constantly ask questions to further my knowledge. 		
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Research Interests:</b> I want to pursue a PhD in experimental astrophysics. 
								I am particularly interested in researching how black holes and dark matter affect galaxy evolution.

								<b>Using Astronomical CCD Imagery Techniques for the Studye of Urban Light Domes at a Small College</b>
								<br>On the summer of 2018, I worked on a computing research project at Westminster College. Our objective
								was to create an image processing pipeline that could take CCD images of the entire night sky and plot its
								levels of sky brightness.

								<b>Space Telescope Science Institute Internship</b>
								<br>During the summer of 2019, I was an intern for the 
								Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. For this project, I worked with the institute’s 
								web development team under the guidance of Matt Scilipoti to create a computer-accessible application 
								programming interface (API) that will allow scientists and the public to utilize the observation schedules 
								of the Hubble Space Telescope. In addition to creating this publicly-available API, I designed a web application, 
								Space Telescope Live, that makes calls to the API and retrieves information about Hubble’s current observations.

								<b>Teaching:</b> I have been both a math tutor and a teacher assistant. I have tutored Multivariate Calculus
								twice, helping my tutees pass the class from an incomplete grade to a B. I was a TA for both Introduction to
								Algebra and Mathematical Methods of Physics. This experience allowed me to provide valuable feedback for
								students and help them conceptualize physics in a mathematical concept.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Outreach:</b> Thanks to the mathematics department at Westminster College, I was able to tutor middle and
								high school students from East High, Utah. This experience was very empowering. Math is often presented as a
								challenging course, discouraging many students. Using both my spanish skills and my sense of humor, I was able
								to connect with many students and encourage them to keep trying.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Equity & Inclusion: </b>Apart from my academic interests, I serve in several leadership positions that allow
								me to promote minority representation and respect. At my school, I am a resident advisor and have been involved
								in numerous clubs. Thanks to these experiences, I have witnessed the value of encouraging
								people to pursue their goals regardless of their background or identity. My aim is to one day be a voice for women
								and people of color within academia because everyone deserves the opportunity to exploit their own curiosity.
